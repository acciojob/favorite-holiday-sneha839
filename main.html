	<h1>Jeju Island</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		Off the southern coast of South Korea is Jeju Island, the countryâ€™s only Special Autonomous Province. Nicknamed Island of the Gods, Jeju is a subtropical destination known as one of the top honeymoon and vacation spots in South Korea. In addition to beautiful beaches, lava tubes and lush green scenery, Jeju boasts a long list of tourist attractions and amusement parks.

You can get to know the local culture at the Seongeup Folklore Village, or you could visit Glass Castle, a theme park that revolves around glass sculptures. Perhaps the oddest and most controversial attraction in Jeju is Loveland, a theme park featuring romantic and adults-only attractions.
